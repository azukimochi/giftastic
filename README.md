This is a GIF search portal for all GIFs that are food-related.  Yes, you're going on a meme-tastic gastric journey!

This GIF search portal was created using JavaScript, CSS, jQuery, and HTML.  Bootstrap was not used for creating this game, but it has been made responsive (see responsive.css).  

The creator of this game is azukimochi and she can be contacted via https://github.com/azukimochi.

Please ensure to download the entire repo in order to have access to all the files.  They are linked via terminal commands.

HOW TO USE:

There are some pre-designed food items in button format underneath the Menu heading.  You can add your own by typing in a keyword into the search bar. A new button related to your keyword will populate, and you can search for GIFs related to that keyword by simply clicking on this new button. Easy as pie! 

Underneath each GIF, there will be a Save button and a Remove button. Click on the Save button to add the GIF to Your Saved GIFs section.  Click the Remove button to take the GIF out of Your Saved GIFs section.  Don't worry, when you refresh the page, the saved list will persist.  Just remember that this is only as long as you don't erase your history!
